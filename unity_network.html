            <h1>About Unity Network</h1>
            <p class="fs-i">
                Unity Network was born out of one of the oldest problems in finance: the lack of power held by individuals over their own financial lives. Centralized banks develop and shelve products, freeze accounts, and seize assets with little or no input from their users. It’s time for a change.
            </p>


            <h4 class="mt-xlarge">Unity Network gives you that power back.</h4>

            <p>Joining our decentralized autonomous network (DAO) gives UNT holders the power to vote on major decisions such as decentralized application (dApp) development, upgrades, marketing efforts, and more. If you’ve ever had an idea concerning the DeFi space that you’d like to see come to fruition, you can propose it here. If it’s feasible and the community agrees, you’ll soon watch your idea become reality in a way that’s far quicker and more agile than bigger, more centralized projects.
            </p>
            <p>This isn’t the only reward for UNT holders. Because each dApp developed by Unity Network is powered by UNT, each added use case drives up the value of the token. This is a powerful incentive for those simply looking to invest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unity Network offers you the power to create a new generation of dApps focused on your unique needs. Head to our Homepage &lt;TBD&gt; to learn how to purchase the UNT token and join the DAO so you can get started.

                <li>
                    <h6>Why is this project named Unity Network?</h6>
                    <p>Unity Network focuses on bringing together people from all walks of life and from all over the globe in an effort to form a community that is smarter, more agile, and more capable than any of us could ever be at an individual level. Through the power of the unified collective, Unity Network aims to serve the individual.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h6>How do I know Unity Network and its dApps are safe for me to use?</h6>
                    <p>In this burgeoning era of cryptocurrency, safety is paramount. Every application developed by Unity Network is thoroughly tested and audited by a reputable firm. We’ll provide an audit report for every dApp we develop. In addition to this, the liquidity of Unity Network’s UNT token is permanently locked. Your safety is always our top priority.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h6>How are Unity Network’s development, administrative, and marketing efforts funded?</h6>
                    <p>In addition to our initial development funds, every dApp Unity Network develops contains a built-in mechanism that sends a small percentage of transacted UNT tokens back to Unity Network. The more dApps we develop and the more usage they see, the more funding Unity Network has to work with.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h6>What is the UNT token?</h6>
                    <p>
                        UNT is the ERC-20 token that powers all of Unity Network’s financial dApps. This means that every new dApp gives the token an additional use case, driving up its value for investors. A small percentage of UNT transactions within these dApps is funneled back to Unity Network, driving further development and marketing efforts.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h6>Why should I use Unity Network when I could develop my own project?</h6>
                    <p>
                        Starting a DeFi project can be challenging, expensive and time-consuming. Many simply can’t put in the hours required for development, marketing, community management, and other administrative tasks, but Unity Network is an easy way for anyone to get involved with DeFi on their own terms and start making major decisions on development and marketing efforts through their votes.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h6>What kinds of dApps can Unity Network develop?</h6>
                    <p>
                        When the Unity community decides on a project, Unity Network staff will determine its feasibility based on current funding and research. If the requisite funding and tech are there, the sky's the limit to what we can develop.

                    <h6>I have questions about Unity Network. Where can I find answers?</h6>
                    <p>
                        You can email us via our Contact Us form above. One of the best ways to get involved, however, is to join Unity Network’s Telegram channel "&lt;TBD&gt;".
